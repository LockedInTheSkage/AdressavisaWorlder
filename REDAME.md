# ordjakt

ordjakt is a solver bot for the Norwegian word game Ordjakt. By running the main script, you get a chat window that allows you to use the bot for solving Ordjakt. It can also be used for other languages by replacing the paths to `common_words` and `total_word_list`. These are lists over all the commonly used words in the language and the all the legal words in the language. The former is usually the list of words the answer might hide among, while the latter is the list of all possible moves to use.

## Installation

The project can be run as is. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Free use
Feel free to modify any section as needed.

## Usage

To use the bot, run the `main.py` script:


```bash
python main.py

For testing the system, you can uncomment the wordler.simulate_game function in the code.
